- A compilation of all the problems I solved (C++) during my competitive coding journey. Some of them maybe incomplete or from the editorials. Most of the Kattis and UVa problems I solved were from [CP4](https://cpbook.net/)

- [template](https://github.com/gnirmal1/competitive-coding/blob/main/template.cpp) I used
- I also wrote a python [script](https://github.com/gnirmal1/competitive-coding/blob/main/commit.py) which help automatically commit and update the README with the links of the new problems solved (currently only works for codeforces, kattis and cses), do check it out if you think its useful!
