# competitive-coding
- A compilation of all the problems I solved during my competitive coding journey. Some of them maybe incomplete or from the editorials. Most of the Kattis and UVa problems I solved were from [CP4](https://cpbook.net/)

- I also wrote a python [script](https://github.com/gnirmal1/competitive-coding/blob/main/commit.py) which help automatically commit and update the README with the links of the new problems solved, do check it out if you think its useful
